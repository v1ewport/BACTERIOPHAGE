# BACTERIOPHAGE
An Arduino Micro custom rubberducky for any Windows system 

The batch script uses NirSoft Password Recovery Utilities to get the following information:

- Network Adapter Info
- Tree of user files
- Saved Wi-Fi keys 
- Saved browsers login credentials (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Opera)

It can access the external usb storage regardless of the drive letter as long as the usb has the label "CARGO"
It can run in any Windows and any processor architecture (Tested in Windows XP x86, Windows 7 x86 and Windows 10 x64)
